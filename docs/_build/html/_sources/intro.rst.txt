Introduction
=============

This package was created to add noise to signals, which can be matrices or
vectors. As of October 2018, only the additive white gaussian noise is
implemented. Future implementations can consider other types of noise, as
listed in `Colors of Noise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise>`_.

Additive White Gaussian Noise
------------------------------
Additive White Guassian Noise (AWGN) is a model of noise that mimics the occurence of random 
processes. AWGN is derived from a normal distribution, having its energy spread across all
spectrum.
