Introduction
=============

This package was created to add noise to signals, which can be matrices or vectors. As of October 2018, only the additive white gaussian noise is implemented.

Additive White Gaussian Noise
------------------------------

Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is a signal generated from a normal distribution. Hence, the noise energy is spread across all spectrum. 

:numref:`fig_noise_spectra` shows the histogram (top) and spectra (bottom) of a typical noise signal.
